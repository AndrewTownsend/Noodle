# Noodle, the new event scheduling tool

A work in progress. Scheduling events should be easy, respect your (and your guests') privacy, and ad-free.

Made with React, Firebase Real-time Database, React Router, and Bootstrap.

## Development

Clone repo, run `npm install`, then `npm start`. You will need to get an .env file from Rachel to access the database.
